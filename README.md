Hello Everyone 

I'm looking for a group or an individual who is willing to tackle a dynamic new problem that will help them compete in technology industries. 
Suggestions are acceptable for resolving complex tasks in an internship project. Further updates and changes are being made to this project.
Our objective is to research the layout that I mention in the files below and to be more creative in the design. A user interface that keeps customers on the page. 
I'm also in need of a back-end developer who wants to learn new challenges in node.js | express.js | react.js | EJS | Redux | MongoDB | MONGOOSE | SQL | Database. 

The back-end are welcome with suggestions, because I deliberately created a couple of pages with missing flowchart for filling the blank.
 
I previously wireframe my web project layout and I need a UI/UX member who is passionate about eye-catching prototype design. 
Terrible mistake at the time, was not aware that a platform like the web stream can animate my prototype. It is only for front-end interface and user interface/ UX designer.

The trick for UI/ UX designer, having alot features or clutter on a page, we must make the page easy to follow to see one thing at a time. 
The layout of the canvas pictures is correct, but there is a problem with the clutter and the color needs to be consistent with the logo. 
The colors will be red, black, white and yellow. Get creative with these 4 colors and stick with these colors again, which is acceptable to have from light red to dark red.

The following challenge for page layout:.

A) Main Page [ Easy ]

B) Profile Page [ Easy - Medium ]

C) Admin Page [ Challenge ]

D) All Pages [ Easy - Challenge ]

We will also learn how to test the UI/UX with another user to get a practical exam with real customers, and update the new repository, so there are more changes, 
until the customer is satisfied. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me for further information about the project: [ Skype - xfactor1989 Email/Hangout - xs.moving.on.fast@gmail.com.  ]

Note: Once the entire project is complete, all contributors will be entitled to share your work as a portfolio for a job you are seeking. 
      At the end of the day, I'm happy to help you with any tasks at no cost.
